#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Tim Julian WÃ¶rner

* Basics

** Package Management
    First, adding in the MELPA repository:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
    #+end_src

    Making sure that =use-package= is loaded:
    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(when (not (package-installed-p 'use-package))
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))
    #+end_src

** Backup File Management
   I don't really like my directories to be cluttered with a lot of backup files, so I am using the =.saves=-folder within my home directory to store them.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq backup-directory-alist `(("." . "~/.saves")))
   #+end_src

** Miscellaneous
   Disabling the Emacs welcome screen on startup. This sets the default startup buffer to =*scratch*=.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
   #+end_src

   The following command disables the Emacs toolbar.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(tool-bar-mode -1)
   #+end_src

   Disabling the "beep" sound entirely:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
   #+end_src

* Theme
  Use the =adwaita= color scheme:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-theme 'adwaita)
  #+end_src

* Magit
  The following command updates the Magit status buffer automatically as soon as a buffer inside the respective repository is saved.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'magit-mode
  (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'magit-after-save-refresh-status t))
  #+end_src

* Org-Mode

** Formatting
   Preserve leading whitespace characters.
   This prevents messed up whitespace at the beginning of lines within a code block.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-src-preserve-indentation t)
   #+end_src

** Babel
   Enable support for the various languages which can be executed from Org-mode.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
 'org-babel-load-languages
 '((racket . t)))
   #+end_src

   I am using a third-party implementation for Racket in =org-babel= which can be found on GitHub: [[https://github.com/togakangaroo/ob-racket]]

   For this to work, the configuration file must be added to the =load-path=:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages/")
(require 'ob-racket)
   #+end_src
